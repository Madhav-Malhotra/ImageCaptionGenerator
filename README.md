# ImageCaptionGenerator
This RNN generates captions for images using a RNN algorithm.

It is based on this tutorial: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.13/tensorflow/contrib/eager/python/examples/generative_examples/image_captioning_with_attention.ipynb

The image data is part of the 2014 COCO dataset, found here: http://cocodataset.org/#home
